Maia: What's wrong, Jin? You look worried!

Jin: Well, my sister is coming to visit me this weekend.

Maia: Oh! That's great!

Jin: No! No it isn't! I have spent most of my time studying and working. I don't know what to do in this city!

Maia:I have done lots of stuff in the city! You don't need to be so anxious.

Jin: Really? You can help? Wow, thank you, Maia!

Maia: No problem, Jin! I'd be happy to give you some ideas.

Jin: OK, let's go!

A: Good evening.
B: Good evening. Where are you going?
A: I am going to a doctor.
B: In what connection?
A: I don't feel well these days.
B: What's the matter?
A: I have always got a headache. I never feel fresh.
B: Do you take exercise?
A: No. I don't find time. You know I am busy in my studies. I study all the time.
B: That's why you don't feel well.
A: What do you mean?
B: I mean, a person who studies all the day and does not take exercise should he not fall ill?
A: Why don't you tell me clearly?
B: Listen. Exercise is very important for health. When Exam is near the students study all the day sitting at one place. Their food does not digest properly. They fall ill.
A: You may be right.
B: Not may be but I am. You do not know the importance of exercise.
A: What should I do then?
B: Take exercise regularly either in the morning or in the evening. But in the morning it is better.
A: You will get well without a doctor in no time.
B: From tomorrow morning, I'll start taking exercise.
A: That is a good thing. Good bye.
B: Good bye. 

Maia: So, what does your sister like? Clubs? Bars? Concerts?

Jin: Um, museums and architecture. Maybe I should do this on my own after all.
